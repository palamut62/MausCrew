# OpenMausBot

**Your own team of AI bots, in a chat app.**

<sub>An open-source version of **Grok Bot** — bring-your-own-agent, local-first, on the models you already have.</sub>

Every bot in the sidebar is a real agent — Claude or Codex running locally under the hood — with its own
personality, its own model, its own cloud computer, and its own connected apps.
Talk to them like contacts. Watch them work. Approve what matters.

## Why

One assistant in one box is the wrong shape for agents. OpenMausBot is an open-source take on **Grok Bot** —
it keeps the idea (AI as a *messaging app*: a roster of bots you chat with, each with its own personality,
memory of its thread, model, computer, and apps) and rebuilds it open, local-first, and on the agents you
already have:

- **Bring your own agents.** Bots run on the `claude`, `codex`, and `grok` CLIs installed on your Mac — your
  existing logins and subscriptions, no new accounts, no proxy in the middle.
- **Local first.** One small harness server on `127.0.0.1` owns every agent process. Transcripts, keys, and
  events live in `~/.openmausbot`, not a cloud.
- **Agents with hands.** Each bot can get a real computer — a cloud Linux desktop it drives while you watch
  live, or your own Mac — plus 500+ apps through Composio Connect.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧠 Pick a brain per bot

A model picker with a provider rail — Claude and Codex models side by side, defaults marked, unavailable
providers dimmed with the reason. Switch a bot's model mid-conversation.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🖥️ Every bot gets a computer

Open the Computer panel and the bot's cloud desktop spins up on its own — live screen preview while it
works, "Open desktop" to take over in your browser, or point the bot at *this Mac* instead.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🙋 Bots ask before they act

Shell commands, file edits, and questions surface as inline cards — Allow / Deny / answer in chat. A
permission broker turns every risky action into a decision you make, for cloud and local computers alike.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔌 Connected apps

A one-click marketplace over Composio Connect: Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Linear and hundreds more.
OAuth once, and every bot can use them as tools.

</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🗂 Manage bots like chats

Right-click any bot: pin, mark unread, edit profile, duplicate, copy conversation ID, hide, delete. It's a
messaging app — your agents behave like contacts.

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🔑 Keys once, everything lights up

Paste credentials in App Settings — they persist locally and the provider fleet hot-reloads instantly.
Secrets are write-only: the UI only ever sees "configured" flags.

**Also in the box:** streaming replies with tool-run activity chips · native macOS dictation from the
composer mic (on-device Apple speech recognition — desktop app) · SupaMaus cursor mascots with role-aware
expressions · screenshots of the bot's work folded into the transcript.

## How it works

Two processes. The app holds no transports of its own — it sends typed commands over HTTP and folds one SSE
event stream into state. The harness server owns every agent process and normalizes each provider's native
protocol into one canonical runtime event stream (logged per-thread as NDJSON).

| Layer | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Drivers | `server/drivers/` | One per provider: Claude, Codex, and Grok Build over their local CLIs (stream-JSON / JSON-RPC / ACP), plus a cloud-computer agent. Unknown drivers degrade to "unavailable", never crash the fleet. |
| Harness | `server/harness/` | Registry (configs → live instances) and the fan-in event bus every client folds. |
| API | `server/index.ts` | Bots, turns, approvals, model catalog, computer lifecycle, connectors, config — HTTP + SSE. |
| App | `src/` | The chat shell. Server-backed store, one reducer, zero client-side transports. |
| Desktop | `electron/` | macOS + Windows shells: dictation helper (SFSpeechRecognizer, macOS only), local screen capture, CUA bridge (macOS only). |

## Quick start

**Easiest:** [download the latest .dmg](https://github.com/milind-soni/openmausbot-releases/releases/latest),
drag it to Applications, open it. The harness server is embedded — no setup.

**From source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot && cd OpenMausBot
pnpm install

pnpm dev:server    # harness server → 127.0.0.1:8799
pnpm dev           # app → http://127.0.0.1:5199
pnpm dev:desktop   # or the Electron shell
```

Requirements: **macOS or Windows**, **Node 24+**, **pnpm**, and at least one agent CLI — [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code),
[`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [`grok`](https://x.ai/cli) — installed and logged in. They appear
in the model picker automatically.

Optional, pasted once in **App Settings** (gear in the sidebar footer):

| Key | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| Composio Connect key (`ck_…`) | The connected-apps marketplace |
| Composio API key (`ak_…`) | The full 500+ app catalog with official logos |
| Box token ([box.ascii.dev](https://box.ascii.dev)) | Cloud computers for your bots |

```sh
pnpm typecheck     # app + server
pnpm build         # typecheck + production build
pnpm package:win   # Windows installer + zip → release/
```

## Status

Early but real — the loop works end to end: message → agent → streamed reply → tools → approvals →
computer use. Rough edges to expect: routines (scheduled tasks) are a placeholder, sidebar sections aren't
built yet, and the Linux shell hasn't been attempted (macOS and Windows both run end to end; the harness
itself is portable Node).

Contributions welcome — the driver SPI in [`server/contracts.ts`](server/contracts.ts) is deliberately
small; adding a provider is one file in [`server/drivers/`](server/drivers/) plus a one-line registration.
